# Milestone 1 Mock Workflows

Status: **Synthetic execution only**. These state machines prove orchestration
and failure semantics; they do not claim ExpressLRS hardware support.

The workflow boundary snapshots the selected descriptor, operation intent, and
Firmware artifact before its first observer/await. Adversarial tests mutate the
caller's original values during progress callbacks and prove that validation,
write, reconnect, verification, and result metadata keep using one immutable
snapshot. Cancellation checkpoints are owned by Core rather than delegated to
Providers.

## Easy Binding

```text
PREPARING
→ IDENTIFYING
→ WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION
→ EXECUTING
→ RECONNECTING
→ VERIFYING
→ SUCCESS
```

The workflow:

1. acquires the exclusive Device Session;
2. reads identity evidence and capabilities;
3. requires `CONFIRMED` identity and `guided-bind` capability;
4. waits for explicit intent;
5. prepares and executes the Binding command;
6. releases the old session and reconnects;
7. reacquires a session and re-reads identity;
8. requires the same confirmed Target;
9. verifies a usable link independently;
10. reports success only after that evidence.

A completed command with no link or `MODEL_MISMATCH` ends in `FAILED` with
`VERIFICATION_FAILED`. A different Target returning ends in `UNKNOWN_STATE`.

## Firmware Update

```text
PREPARING
→ IDENTIFYING
→ WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION
→ EXECUTING
→ WRITE_COMPLETED
→ REBOOTING
→ RECONNECTING
→ VERIFYING
→ SUCCESS
```

Before the synthetic write, the workflow requires:

- artifact integrity from the provider;
- confirmed identity;
- exact artifact/Target match;
- supported Firmware major;
- supported update provider;
- explicit user intent.

After the write, it reacquires and re-identifies the returned device, then
checks the observed Target and Firmware version. `WRITE_COMPLETED` is an
intermediate fact, never a success state.

## Failure disposition

| Evidence | Final state | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Permission denied or failure before write | `FAILED` | No write began |
| Connection lost while write result is unknown | `UNKNOWN_STATE` | Do not assume written or unchanged |
| Write completed but device does not return | `RECOVERY_REQUIRED` | Recovery/reconnect workflow needed |
| Different Target returns after write | `RECOVERY_REQUIRED` | Expected device identity not proved |
| Wrong/unverified Firmware version | `RECOVERY_REQUIRED` | Postcondition failed |
| Binding command completes but link is absent | `FAILED` | Safe retry may be offered after recheck |
| User declines before execution | `CANCELLED` | No command/write runs |

## Deterministic fixtures

The Synthetic layer covers:

- known TX 2.4 GHz, known RX Sub-GHz, and LR1121 dual-band families;
- unknown, ambiguous, conflicting, and duplicate identity evidence;
- unsupported Firmware major and invalid artifact;
- permission denial;
- disconnect at each Binding and Update provider stage;
- reconnect to the same device, wrong Target, wrong version, or no device;
- Binding without a link and with Model Mismatch;
- deterministic clock and complete provider-call histories;
- privacy-classified Synthetic discovery replay traces for regression cases;
- retry as a fresh invocation that always starts by re-reading identity and
  capabilities.

Every fixture is invented for the test suite and contains no copied ExpressLRS
Target database material.
