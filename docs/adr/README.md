# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs تسجل `Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences`. لا يُعاد تحرير تاريخ القرار؛ التغيير ينشئ ADR جديدًا superseding السابق.

السجل الحالي:

- ADR-0004: TypeScript Core + React/Vite Web — accepted for M1.
- ADR-0005: provider completion is not operation success — accepted gate.
